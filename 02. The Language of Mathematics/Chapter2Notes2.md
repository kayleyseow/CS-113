#### Sequences
- A sequence is a list of things
- For example: 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, -3, -5
- Our sequences will contain only numbers, though they can actually contain anything
- Sequences can be infinite or finite
  - Ours will be finite
- We will refer to a sequence as follows:  
  a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>,a<sub>3</sub>, a<sub>4</sub>, …, a<sub>n</sub>  
- Each item in a sequence is called a term

#### Ideas About Sequences
- If the elements in the sequence satisfy <i>a<sub>i</sub></i> < <i>a<sub>j</sub></i> whenever _i_ < _j_ the sequence is increasing
  - For example, the sequence 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, … is increasing
- If the elements in the sequence satisfy <i>a<sub>i</sub></i> > <i>a<sub>j</sub></i> whenever _i_ < _j_ the sequence is decreasing
  - For example, the sequence 7, 5, 3, 1, … is decreasing
- Also, if you take some of the terms, it is called a subsequence

#### Combining the Terms
- If we add the terms of a sequence, we call it a series
- We can also multiply the terms
- Then we get a product
- It may also be infinite or finite

#### Notation
- We will write a series like this:  
![Summation Equation from i=1 to n for equation ai](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47701395/109381040-c02f1e00-788c-11eb-91a9-607d9fde64fa.png)  
  - This will mean a<sub>1</sub>+ a<sub>2</sub> + a<sub>3</sub> + … + a<sub>n</sub>
- It’s similar for a product:  
![Cumulative Product Equation from i=1 to n for equation ai](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47701395/109381089-fec4d880-788c-11eb-8b77-1ba869a8e4d2.png)  
  - This will mean a<sub>1</sub>\*a<sub>2</sub>\*a<sub>3</sub>\*...\*a<sub>n</sub>

#### Checking on the Notation
- Let’s try #10, 22 on p. 69

#### Recursive Definitions
- Sequences and series can also be defined recursively
- For example, p. 69, #44
