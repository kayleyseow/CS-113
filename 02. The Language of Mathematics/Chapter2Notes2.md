#### Sequences
- A sequence is a list of things
- For example: 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, -3, -5
- Our sequences will contain only numbers, though they can actually contain anything
- Sequences can be infinite or finite
  - Ours will be finite
- We will refer to a sequence as follows:  
  a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>,a<sub>3</sub>, a<sub>4</sub>, â€¦, a<sub>n</sub>  
- Each item in a sequence is called a term
