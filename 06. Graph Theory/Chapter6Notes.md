## Chapter 6 Notes: Graph Theory (Applications)
CS-113 Discrete Structures  

#### Applications of Graphs
- There are lots of ideas that come from or lead to applications of graphs
- Here are a few

#### Vocabulary to Know
- A graph is made up of
  - **Vertices**
  - **Edges** connecting the vertices

#### The Königsberg Bridges

#### The Königsberg Bridges and Graphs
- Here is the connection to graphs:  
  - We label the top bank A
  - We label the bottom bank B
  - We label the left island C
  - We label the right island D
- We connect the vertices as in the picture

#### The Road Inspector Problem
- A person is responsible for keeping the roads in an area in good working (driving?) order
- We draw a map of the area
- This is the connection to graphs
  - The cities are vertices
  - The roads are edges

#### The Travelling Salesperson Problem
- This is similar to the road inspector problem
- This is the connection to graphs
  - The vertices in the graph are cities
  - The edges are roads connecting the cities
- The graph could be weighted
  - The edges might be weighted based on the cost of travel
  - The edges might be weighted based on the number of miles

#### A Drill Press
- You have a sheet of metal
- You have a drill press that can be programmed
- You want to drill a series of holes in the metal
- What’s the shortest path connecting all holes?
- This is the connection to graphs
  - The holes are vertices
  - Thee graph is made up of edges connecting each pair of holes
