# About
This repository has my complete coursework for the CS-113: Discrete Structures class, including all of my notes, code, homework, and classwork. It is divided into 9 folders; 8 are for the different chapters that we covered in this class, and 1 is for material pertaining to the course final. Aside from the folders and 2 files for the repository, there are 3 uncategorized files, from my own extended studies on subjects taught in the curriculum. Only my written code and responses in this repository belong to me; all the other materials are created by and belong to my instructor, the textbook, and any other credited sources.
