#### Words That Can Be Made From the Letters in the Word Fremont
- By “words” here I mean sequences of letters
- The sequences may not be actual English words
  - For example, I will consider FTMNR to be a word
- The question is:  
  - How many 7-letter words can we make from “Fremont”
- There are 7 letters, so the number of words (permutations!) is 7!

#### Words That Can Be Made From the Letters in the Words Apple Pie
- Let’s pretend that apple pie is one big word applepie
- The number of letters there is 8
- Let me number the letters:  
  | 1 	| 2 	| 3 	| 4 	| 5 	| 6 	| 7 	| 8 	|
  |-	|-	|-	|-	|-	|-	|-	|-	|
  | A 	| P 	| P 	| L 	| E 	| P 	| I 	| E 	|  
- I will indicate words by listing the letters
- For example, 2-7-5 is pie
- What is 3-7-4-8?
