#### Words That Can Be Made From the Letters in the Word Fremont
- By “words” here I mean sequences of letters
- The sequences may not be actual English words
  - For example, I will consider FTMNR to be a word
- The question is:  
  - How many 7-letter words can we make from “Fremont”
- There are 7 letters, so the number of words (permutations!) is 7!
