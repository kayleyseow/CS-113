#### Some Preliminary Ideas
- Idea 1: What do odd and even mean?
  - `n` odd means that `n = 2k+1`, and `n` even `n = 2k` for some integer `k`.
  - Find `k` for 15, 18.
- Idea 2: `x > y` and `z > t` implies that `x+z > y+t`.
  - Based on properties of real numbers.
- Idea 3: Positives multiplied by positives give positives
  - That is, `a > 0` and `b > 0` implies that `ab > 0`
- Idea 4:
  - `x > y > 0` and `z > t > 0` means that `xz > yt`. 

#### Direct Proof
- Theorem A: If `a` and `b` are two positive numbers, and `a > b`, then `a`<sup>2</sup> `>` `b`<sup>2</sup>.
- Theorem B: If `n` is an odd integer then `n`<sup>2</sup> is also odd.

#### Indirect Proof
- Theorem C: If `n`<sup>2</sup> is an even integer then `n` is also even.
- Theorem D: The square root of 2 (√2) is irrational; that is, it can’t be written as a fraction of two integers.

#### Proof Using the Contrapositive
- Theorem E: If `n`<sup>2</sup> is an even integer then `n` is also even.
- Theorem F: If a product of two positive real numbers is greater than 100, then at least one of the numbers is greater than 10.

#### Proof Using Cases
- Also called Proof by Exhaustion
- Theorem G: `lim as (x->4) of x-3 = 1`
  - This is a two-sided limit
- Theorem H: Prove that if n is any integer not divisible by 3, then `n`<sup>2</sup> leaves a remainder of 1 when it is divided by 3.
