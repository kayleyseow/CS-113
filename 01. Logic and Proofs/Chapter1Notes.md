#### Propositions
- A proposition is a statement that is either true or false
  - “I am wearing shoes” IS a proposition
  - “It’s raining” IS a proposition
  - “This sentence is false” is NOT a proposition
  - “Is it 9:00?” is NOT a proposition
- We will use p, q, r, s to represent propositions

#### Combining Propositions
- There are three main ways we can combine propositions
- Method 1: Conjunction
  - We normally call this AND
  - We write p ^ q
  - p^q is true only if both p and q are two otherwise false

#### Truth Tables
- Truth tables are a simple way to express and/or determine the truth or falsity of a proposition
- We write all propositions across the top
- We fill in T (for true) and F( for false) under them
- We then build the rest of the table until we see the entire proposition
- The list of Ts and Fs at then end is called the truth value of the proposition  

| p 	| q 	| p^q (Truth value of p and q) 	|  
|-	|-	|-	|  
| t 	| t 	| t 	|  
| t 	| f 	| f 	|  
| f 	| t 	| f 	|  
| f 	| f 	| f 	|
