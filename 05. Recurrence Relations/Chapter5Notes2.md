## Chapter 5 Notes: Recurrence Relations
CS-113 Discrete Structures  

#### Solving a Recurrence Relation
- Solving a recurrence relation means to put it into closed form
- Here is an example:  
  - a<sub>1</sub>= 3
  - a<sub>n+1</sub>= a<sub>n</sub>+2, n >= 1
- We write out several terms:  
  - a<sub>1</sub> = 3
  - a<sub>2</sub> = a<sub>1</sub> + 2 = 3 + 2
  - a<sub>3</sub> = a<sub>2</sub> + 2 = 3 + 2 + 2
- Continuing, we see that
  - a<sub>n</sub> = 3+2(n-1)
- This process is called iteration
